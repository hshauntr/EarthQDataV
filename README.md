# Earthquake Data Visualization: Project Overview

## Background

Understanding earthquake data and its distribution worldwide is crucial for researchers and the public alike. Through this project, we leverage data science and visualization techniques to present earthquake data in a visually appealing and accessible manner.

The GUI application we are building aims to make earthquake data more understandable and engaging. Users will have the flexibility to explore seismic activity for different years, enabling them to identify patterns and trends over time. The continuous functionality of the GUI ensures a seamless experience while analyzing earthquake data for various periods.

By developing this earthquake data visualization application, we contribute valuable insights to researchers and the public, fostering a deeper understanding of global seismic activity and its changes over time. Our project showcases our proficiency in data handling, visualization, and creating practical, interactive applications for real-world applications.

## Objective 
The main aim of this data science project is to create a user-friendly application with a graphical interface to visualize earthquake data. The application will display the location and magnitude of significant earthquakes from various parts of the world over several decades. Our goals are as follows:

1. Develop an intuitive GUI that allows users to input a specific year and view a detailed world map highlighting significant earthquakes for that chosen year.
2. Provide historical trends of earthquake occurrences and emphasize the selected year's seismic activity on the map.
3. Ensure smooth functionality, allowing users to explore earthquake data for different years without the need to restart the application.
